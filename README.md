# Calc64 #

Commodore Calculator for Commodore 64, PET, 128, 16, Plus/4, etc.

This is an example calculator program including operator precedence.  Use is like a handheld calculator.  Keys are shown on screen.  Works in 40 and 80 column screens.  A few manual edits to adjust screen use (lines 1-9) and it will work on Vic-20 as well!   Only works with integers at this time.  It is intended to be upgraded.
